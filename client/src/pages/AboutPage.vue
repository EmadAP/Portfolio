          I'm a Junior Front-End Developer with a passion for building modern,
          responsive, and user-friendly applications. Most of my experience is
          with React, Next.js, TypeScript, React Query, Tailwind CSS, and
          Shadcn/UI, where I focus on creating clean interfaces and smooth user
          experiences. While my main focus is on front-end development, I also
          have hands-on knowledge of Express.js, MongoDB, and Axios, which
          allows me to build and connect simple backends for my own projects.
          Recently, I’ve been expanding my skills by learning Vue, adding
          another perspective to my development toolkit.

          My journey in development has taught me to balance design and
          functionality—making sure that apps not only look good but also
          perform efficiently and scale well. I enjoy tackling new challenges,
          learning different frameworks, and continuously improving my craft.
          Problem-solving and experimenting with new ideas keep me motivated,
          and I aim to bring clarity and usability to every project I work on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I like exploring new technologies, keeping up with
          modern web trends, and finding ways to grow as both a developer and a
          creator. Whether I’m building personal projects or experimenting with
          new tools, I’m always excited to learn and push my skills further.
